# Deploying GrayMeta Iris Anywhere with Terraform

The following contains instructions/criteria for deploying Iris Anywhere into an AWS environment.  Iris Anywhere is comprised of two key components, the Iris Admin Server that manages Users, permissions and Licenses and the Iris Anywhere Autoscaling Group that deploy the instances for usage. Iris Anywhere Autoscaling Group will not properly function without a dedicated `ia_admin_server` deployed first. 

* Contact support@graymeta.com to get access to AMI.
* Terraform 12 is only supported at this time.
* `version` - Current version is `v0.0.1`.

***
## Iris Anywhere Admin Server
Deploys Iris Admin management server. This application provides comprehensive administrative capabilities, API and development support.  Iris Admin Server must be deployed, licensed and configured prior to the deployment of the Autoscaling Groups as there are dependent variables ascertained during the process (`ia_customer_id`, `ia_admin_server`, `ia_s3_conn_id`, `ia_s3_conn_code`).  

The below example will allow you to deploy your Iris Admin Server. After the deployment is complete navigate to the instance's {Public IPv4 DNS}:8020 to log in to your Iris Admin Server.  Once successfully logged in, contact support@graymeta.com to license your product as well as retrieve the necessary variables to deploy your Iris Anywhere Autoscaling Groups.

## Example Usage

```
provider "aws" {
  region  = "us-west-2"
  profile = "my-aws-profile"
}

module "irisadmin" {
  source = "github.com/graymeta/terraform-aws-irisanywhere//admin?ref=v0.0.1"
    
  access_cidr     = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  hostname_prefix = "iadm"
  instance_count  = 1
  instance_type   = "t3.xlarge"

  iadm_uid        = "AdminUID"
  iadm_pw         = "YourPassword"
  iadmdb_pw       = "YourDBPassword"
}
```

## Iris Anywhere Autoscaling Groups
Deploys Application Load Balancer and Autoscaling group.  We recommend that you do not deploy your Autoscaling Groups until your Iris Admin Server has been licensed with GrayMeta (support@graymeta.com), during this process you will be provided additional key values to plug into your terraform code (`ia_customer_id`, `ia_admin_server`, `ia_s3_conn_id`, `ia_s3_conn_code`).

Example: Add a resource block like this to your `main.tf`.

```
resource "aws_autoscaling_schedule" "iris1_schedule_start" {
  scheduled_action_name  = "iris1-schedule-start"
  recurrence             = "0 16 * * MON-FRI"
  desired_capacity       = 2
  max_size               = 10
  min_size               = 2
  autoscaling_group_name = module.iris1.asg_name
}

resource "aws_autoscaling_schedule" "iris_anywhere_9xl_schedule_end" {
  scheduled_action_name  = "iris1-schedule-end"
  recurrence             = "0 6 * * MON-FRI"
  desired_capacity       = 0
  max_size               = 10

  autoscaling_group_name = module.iris1.asg_name
}
```
