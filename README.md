# Deploying GrayMeta Iris Anywhere with Terraform

The following contains instructions/criteria for deploying Iris Anywhere into an AWS environment. Iris Anywhere is comprised of two key components, the Iris Admin Server that manages Users, permissions and Licenses and the Iris Anywhere Autoscaling Group that deploy the instances for usage. Iris Anywhere Autoscaling Group will not properly function without a dedicated Iris Admin Server deployed first.

Prerequisites:

- Stored credentials in [Secrets Manager](#creating-secrets-for-iris-anywhere) prior to deploying.
- Access to GrayMeta Iris Admin and Iris Anywhere AMI's - Contact support@graymeta.com.
- Certificates created or imported in AWS Certificate Manager.
- Terraform 12 & 13 are supported at this time.
- `version` - Current version is `v0.0.8`.

## Iris Anywhere Admin Server

Deploys Iris Admin management server. This application provides comprehensive administrative capabilities, API and development support. An Iris Admin Server must be deployed, licensed and configured prior to the deployment of the Autoscaling Groups as there are dependent variables ascertained during the process.

The below example will allow you to deploy your Iris Admin Server. After the deployment is complete navigate to the instance's {Public IPv4 DNS}:8020 to log in to your Iris Admin Server. Once successfully logged in, contact support@graymeta.com to license your product as well as retrieve the necessary variables to deploy your Iris Anywhere Autoscaling Groups.

## Example Usage

```
provider "aws" {
  region  = "us-west-2"
  profile = "my-aws-profile"
}

module "irisadmin" {
  source = "github.com/graymeta/terraform-aws-irisanywhere//admin?ref=v0.0.8"

  access_cidr     = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  hostname_prefix = "iadm"
  instance_count  = 1

  key_name        = "my_key"
  ia_secret_arn   = "arn:aws:secretsmanager:secret:1234567913397769129"

### Creating Secrets for Iris Anywhere

Before you can deploy Iris Admin and Iris Anywhere (ASG), you will need to create a secret in AWS Secrets Manager with the following keys/values:

Required by Iris Admin server (these inputs are specified by you)

- Key : Value
- `admin_db_id` : userid for Iris Admin database
- `admin_db_pw` : password for Iris Admin database
- `admin_console_id` : userid of Iris Admin console
- `admin_console_pw` : password for Iris Admin console

Required by Iris Anywhere ASG:

- Key : Value
- `admin_customer_id` : provided by GrayMeta licensing
- `admin_server` : DNS of Iris Admin server
- `iris_s3_bucketname` : Name of S3 bucket you would like to attach to Iris Anywhere
- `iris_s3_access_key` : IAM Access Key with permission to access bucket
- `iris_s3_secret_key` : IAM Secret key associated with access key
- `iris_s3_lic_code` : S3 connector license code - provided by GrayMeta during licensing
- `iris_s3_lic_id` : S3 connector license id - provided by GrayMeta during licensing
- `iris_serviceacct` : account used to run Iris Anywhere

Secrets required for End to End SSL (optional). Create two seperate secret credentials:

- `Certificate in X509 DER format` in plain text.
- `Certificate Private Key` in plain text.

### Creating DNS for the Iris ASG load balancer

Create a DNS record for your Iris Anywhere implementation. A CNAME pointing to the load balancer.
